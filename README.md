# C Programming Examples: Control Structures & Basic Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of C programs demonstrating essential programming concepts such as decision-making (if-else, switch-case), loops, and basic algorithms (factorial, Fibonacci, decimal-to-binary conversion).

## Overview of Programs

### 1. Voting Eligibility Using If-Else
- Takes user input for age.
- Checks if age is 18 or above to determine voting eligibility using `if-else`.

### 2. Voting Eligibility Using Ternary Operator
- Simplifies the voting eligibility check with the ternary conditional operator (`?:`).

### 3. Day of the Week Using Switch-Case
- User inputs a number (1-7).
- Program outputs the corresponding day of the week using a `switch` statement.

### 4. Lucky Number Based on Birth Date
- Calculates a "lucky number" by summing digits of the birth date.
- Uses nested switch-cases to print messages based on the calculated number.

### 5. Summation and Factorial of Numbers 1 to 5
- Calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.
- Calculates and prints the factorial of numbers from 1 to 5 using a `for` loop.

### 6. Fibonacci Series Generator
- Prints Fibonacci series up to `n` terms (user input).
- Uses loop and variables to generate the sequence.

### 7. Factorial of a User-Entered Number
- Calculates factorial of any non-negative integer entered by the user.
- Validates input to ensure non-negativity.

### 8. Decimal to Binary Conversion
- Converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.
- Outputs the binary number as an integer (digits 0 and 1).

## How to Compile & Run

1. Compile the C program using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
